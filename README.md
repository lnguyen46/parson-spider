# Javascript web crawler

## Intro.
It is used to scrape financial aid information on [CollegeBoard](https://www.collegeboard.org).

There are more than 3000 colleges in the USA but only 787 colleges have financial aid for international students.

I build this tool to collect data that help international students quick search the average aid they can receive from a particular college.

## How to use
Make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

`cd ~`

`cd folder-you-want-to-hold-this-repo`

`git clone https://github.com/lnguyen46/parson-spider.git`

`node get_college_names.js`

`node calculate_aid.js`







## Demo app.
I have visualized the data! You can see it [here](https://int-aid-table.herokuapp.com).
